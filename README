Hi
This is my experiment with Ansible playbooks 

## Main Configuration files
1. /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg #contains all configuration details 
2. /etc/ansible/hosts       #It's inventory files which contains hosts , groups list

## Commands

#to check the connectivity of target machine

1. ansible -i hots all -m ping  
2. ansible <group/machine> -m <module> -a <args>

3. ansible all -a "df -kh" -i /etc/ansible/hosts
4. ansible all -m ping -i /etc/ansible/hosts 
5. ansible all -a "sudo which nginx " -i /etc/ansible/hosts


   ansible <hosts/machine> -a <command> -i hosts -u <user_name>
